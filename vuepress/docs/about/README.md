# About

**Shardcake** is a project developed at [**Devsisters**](https://www.devsisters.com) by the team behind the popular game [**Cookie Run: Kingdom**](https://www.cookierun-kingdom.com). 
We have been successfully using this project in production since March 2022.

If you happen to be in South Korea, we are [recruiting](https://careers.devsisters.com/position/detail/?jobPosition=19)!

**Shardcake** was developed after years of experience with [**Akka Cluster Sharding**](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/cluster-sharding.html).
Even though code has nothing in common with Akka, credits go to them for some ideas and concepts.
